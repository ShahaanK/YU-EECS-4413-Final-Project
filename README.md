# EEECS-4413-Final-Project
The Vibez - Online Clothing Store
Welcome to The Vibez, an interactive online clothing store developed by the team "404 Not Found". This README provides an overview of the project's architecture, design decisions, implementation details, strengths, challenges, and key takeaways.

We were successful in developing a e-commerce website that selling clothing catered to female leaning audiences. We had multiple set backs during the development process from having to redesign a frontend completely to having to discovering the long forgotten details of servlets. We created a working check-in/out system, coupled with multiple servlets in a DAO and MVC model. In addition we created various jsp files to accommodate the delegation of display and made sure to include an additional feature of randomization and an analytics page. The hardest work is unseen as it is done in the backend. Overall we met what we set out to achieve.
